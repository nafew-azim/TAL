# TAL

Code for **TAL** : a metacognitive multi-agent system.

TAL coordinates specialized experts with adaptive loss-guided inference, episodic memory, and self-monitoring to improve in-context learning and collaborative task execution.

Here are the Hugging Face links to the datasets :

### General Reasoning & Benchmark Datasets

1. **GSM8K**: A dataset of grade-school math word problems with step-by-step solutions.
